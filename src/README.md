DCC Presence Detection + Intelligent USD Routing
You’re already detecting DCCs launching — extend this with a real “presence layer” that knows:
Who’s active
Which stage is open
What department is contributing (layout, anim, lighting)
Use that info to route USD changes contextually.
💡 Invented Tech: A “smart scene bus” that routes scene updates like packets across a creative network.
